# Power Consumption Extension

Having a laptop with not much battery and a backlit keyboard made me wonder how much power it was spending at each moment. Being able to gather that information from the system and putting it into a shell script was the first thing to do, but as I use Gnome on my daily basis, I just created this small extension to show up the power consumption.

Currently it refreshes each second

## Wishlist:

- Preferences to set the refresh rate
- Detect more than one battery
- Detect if there's no battery and show just a `-`
- Select Battery to take power consumption from

## Changelog:

### 0.1

- First Version, just showing power consumption
